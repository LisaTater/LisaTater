Skit Title: "Quantum Leap: Securing Our Future"
Setting: A modern tech lab filled with screens, quantum devices, and holographic displays.
Characters:
Sam: A cybersecurity expert
Riley: A curious tech novice
Eve: A quirky AI hologram representing cyber threats
(Sam is working at a console, typing furiously. Riley enters, looking intrigued.)

Riley: Hey Sam! What’s all this about quantum security? It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie!

Sam: (grinning) It does have that vibe! But quantum security is a game changer for protecting information.

Eve: (playfully) Safety? Easy peasy! Just dodge lightning bolts, right?

Sam: (chuckles) Well, safety is about protecting against random events—like lightning strikes or power spikes.

Riley: And security?

Sam: Security is a bit trickier. It protects against intentional attacks from savvy adversaries who know what you’re doing—and maybe more about cryptography than you do!


Sam: In quantum security, our message is a bit stream—this includes encryption, transmission, and decryption. But we do it using quantum states!  

Riley: So how do we turn bits into quantum states?

Sam: We use the polarization of photons!

Eve: (excitedly) Like BB84! It uses two bases: rectilinear and diagonal.

Sam: Exactly! In the rectilinear basis, we use vertical and horizontal polarizations. In the diagonal basis, we use diagonal polarizations.

Riley: Got it! But what if someone tries to eavesdrop?


Sam: That’s where E91 comes in. It uses entangled pairs of particles. If you measure one, you instantly know the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are!
(Eve feigns shock.)

Eve: But what if I want to listen in?

Sam: (confidently) That’s the beauty of quantum mechanics! Any attempt to intercept changes the state of the photons, alerting us to eavesdropping.

Riley: And what’s this SARG04 you mentioned?

Sam: SARG04 improves upon BB84 by encoding information differently, making it more robust against photon-number-splitting attacks, which can compromise the security of BB84.

(Eve pretends to pout.)
Eve: No more Photon Number splitting? That’s just unfair!

Sam: Our ultimate goal is the quantum internet. Imagine sending quantum signals securely across networks!

Riley: That sounds revolutionary!

Slide 3:
Sam: With EAGLE 1, we’re developing secure communications using quantum key distribution, ensuring our data stays protected. In short, EAGLE 1 uses the unique behaviors of light particles to create a very secure way of sharing information, ensuring that communications stay private and safe.


(Eve takes on a serious tone.)
Eve: But what about the challenges we face today, like privacy concerns and cybercrime?
Slide 4: 
Sam: Those are real issues. But with quantum security, we have innovative solutions that can help tackle them. For example, our Terra Truth Guard ICO will provide some physical security by the ability to detect real-time lying, analyze the user’s intent, and provide intuitive feedback. There are also 2 other types of Internet Security namely, human biometrics, and updated legislation protocols.

Riley: (enthusiastically) I’m ready for this quantum future!  Especially, STELLAR and all those security ICOs!!!
I can’t wait until our current internet security takes a quantum leap into the future.  We have a Stellar future ahead!!! 
With NETX (built on Xelmo- allowing for a fully interconnected internet) transforming the internet. 
Fediverse allowing us to have one service which allows us to post on others, and 
Activity Pub that is decentralized and really pulls everything together allowing different social media platforms to communicate and share content with each other. 
This means that no single entity or platform has total control over the entire internet.

Eve: (smirking) Just remember, I’ll always be lurking around!
(All characters share a laugh as the lights dim.)
[End Scene]

Notes:
This skit effectively conveys complex quantum security concepts in an engaging manner, using humor and relatable characters to help the audience understand key ideas like BB84, E91, and the potential of the quantum internet.
